<div class="textblock"><p>The <code>drbbdup</code> DynamoRIO Basic Block Duplicator Extension provides a mechanism to efficiently support different instrumentations of the same basic blocks. Although flushing is one viable approach to achieve this functionality, it unfortunately also incurs high overheads. Instead, drbbdup duplicates the code of each basic block to generate multiple copies and enables a client to instrument these copies with different code insertions.</p>

</div>
<p>The duplication of a basic block is done at drmgr's app2app stage. Copies are prefixed by a START label, and followed by a jump instruction to direct control to the EXIT label. Note that the last code version does not need this jump. Each basic block copy is set to handle a particular case of instrumentation. A case is identified by a unique pointer-sized value that is registered by the client. The last basic block always handles the default case. During the insertion stage, the code of the dispatcher is prepended to the fragment. The dispatcher encodes the current runtime case as instructed by the client, and compares the encoding with those of the handled cases. If a match is found, the dispatcher directs control to the appropriate basic block. Otherwise, the basic block handling the default case is executed.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_drbbdup_init"></a>
Setup</h1>
<p>To use <code>drbbdup</code> with your client simply include this line in your client's <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">use_DynamoRIO_extension(clientname drbbdup) </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>That will automatically set up the include path and library dependence.</p>
<p>The initialization routine <code><a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#ga70e7a3c219a3a1d1492af8d626e9832e">drbbdup_init()</a></code> must be called prior to any of the other routines. The managing of basic block copies is specific to a single use-case, where only one default case can be registered. Therefore, additional calls to <code><a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#ga70e7a3c219a3a1d1492af8d626e9832e">drbbdup_init()</a></code> are not allowed. The option fields mainly consist of user-defined call-back functions which dictate how drbbdup manages duplications.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_drbbdup_bb"></a>
Duplication</h1>
<p>When drbbdup encounters a new basic block, it invokes the <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#gafc69f147f9c66259b8890b0d5aef38d8">drbbdup_set_up_bb_dups_t</a> call-back function. This enables the client to return the encoding value of the default case as well as register additional case encodings via <code><a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#ga8f8164a0d83acbd0340cfd470775c27e">drbbdup_register_case_encoding()</a></code>. The client may also completely disable duplication for this particular basic block by falsifying a flag that is provided to the call-back function.</p>
<p>When only two cases are used, the default and one additional, and the encoding value for one of them is zero, drbbdup is able to generate faster case dispatch code. To produce optimal code for x86, it is best to have the default case use the non-zero encoding.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_drbbdup_analysis"></a>
Case Analysis</h1>
<p>There are two types of analysis call-back functions that are supported by drbbdup. The <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#ga9ad6ccdf892113423001b6559e4ee8e8">drbbdup_analyze_orig_t</a> call-back function is invoked per fragment, while the <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#ga1635c9540f9b8de24bfc0e37a5ba60da">drbbdup_analyze_case_t</a> call-back function is triggered for each registered case. The former enables the client to derive analysis data of the basic block that is made available during the instrumentation of all cases. Usually, the analysis conducted is expensive and is therefore implemented in this call-back function to avoid its repetition when managing each case. Meanwhile, the <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#ga1635c9540f9b8de24bfc0e37a5ba60da">drbbdup_analyze_case_t</a> call-back function is analysis done particularly for a given case.</p>
<p>The client may implement <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#gafa4a35ea9eab76f19c533b7944ee3ff8">drbbdup_destroy_orig_analysis_t</a> and <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#gacfdd196f0a774cc7086fff7a2fed0ce1">drbbdup_destroy_case_analysis_t</a> call-back functions to destroy the respective analysis data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, should the client perform some analysis prior to duplication during the app2app stage via a separate event, then such data should be stored and accessed via TLS.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_drbbdup_encoder"></a>
Encoder</h1>
<p>In order for drbbdup to dispatch control to the appropriate basic block copy, it needs to determine the current runtime case encoding value. Essentially, this process depends on the use-case, and therefore drbbdup optionally invokes the <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#gae2bf28a5b20a165d4d07325a49c12c4a">drbbdup_insert_encode_t</a> call-back function to obtain the encoding from the client.</p>
<p>In terms of implementation, the call-back function must store the runtime case encoding to pointer-sized memory that is maintained by the client itself. By using the operand, which refers to the memory and is passed to <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#ga70e7a3c219a3a1d1492af8d626e9832e">drbbdup_init()</a>, drbbdup will load the current runtime case encoding and dispatch control accordingly.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#gae2bf28a5b20a165d4d07325a49c12c4a">drbbdup_insert_encode_t</a> call-back may also be set to NULL which results in the dispatcher not attempting the construction of the runtime case at every start of a basic block execution. In such cases, it is expected that the client directly sets the runtime encoding and updates the value on demand. The drbbdup extension guarantees that it does not modify the set encoding on its own accord.</p>
<p>A PC-relative case encoding operand is supported on AArchXX, with drbbdup adding code to obtain the linear address and so avoid reachability problems.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_drbbdup_instrum"></a>
Case Instrumentation</h1>
<p>drbbdup invokes the <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#ga8928e3a20e86418d0371b3ec4e69d8cc">drbbdup_instrument_instr_t</a> call-back function to trigger the instrumentation of an instruction. Instrumentation must be done with respect to the currently considered case which is passed as a parameter by drbbdup. Moreover, while drbbdup supplies the instruction which the client considers for instrumentation, it also provides a "where" instruction. The client must insert code exactly prior to the "where" instruction in order to ensure correct instrumentation. Internally, this approach enables instructions (e.g., syscall and jmp), which cannot be duplicated due to the breaking of basic block structure, to have different case instrumentation nonetheless.</p>
<p>drbbdup also provides <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#ga033b7015cc84c05542d96e886a11e588">drbbdup_is_first_instr()</a>, <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#ga4bd1d3123285d7da1c3f8a4cc53d6633">drbbdup_is_first_nonlabel_instr()</a> and <a class="el" href="group__drbbdup.html#ga8b714ca5a27b1a31cf945391e98d2e4c">drbbdup_is_last_instr()</a> to determine whether the passed instruction is the first, first non label and last instruction of a basic block copy respectively. Note the client should not use drmgr varients such as <a class="el" href="group__drmgr.html#gadd8688fd6cc4d7e1f804ccd1460f5177">drmgr_is_first_instr()</a> as these API functions do not take into account drbbdup's internals and therefore will fail. </p>
